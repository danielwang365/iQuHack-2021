# Dots and Gates: An Education in Quantum Gate Mechanics

Daniel Wang, Ramya Iyer, Emma Li, Venkata Menta, and Elle Renshaw

## Introduction
The world of quantum seems inaccessible to many people our age. We wanted to provide an opportunity for quantum learners to learn about gates in a game format, so they too can explore the wonders of the quantum world. 

The game has three gates: 
Pauli-X - This gate is the quantum equivalent of a classical NOT gate. 
Hadamard - This gate places the qubit in a superposition state. 
Measurement - This gate measures the quantum state of the qubit, and consolidates the qubit to a single value. 

In this game, we give people the opportunity to learn the functions of these three gates in a simple, straightforward way. 

## Goals 
The goal of our project is to provide a learning environment for individuals interested in quantum computing. We want to teach  the basic concept of quantum gates in a unique, memorable way. 

Hopefully, people who play our game will have a more complete knowledge of what quantum gates are, and it will help them in their quantum computing endeavors. 

## Mechanics of Dots and Gates
The premise of the game is to get your dot through the Pauli-X and Hadamard gates to achieve a certain value. 

The player can use the arrow keys to control the direction of their dot. Once the dot goes through the Pauli-X gate or the Hadamard gate, it changes the value. 

The Pauli-X gate acts as a not gate and flips the value from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa. 
The Hadamard gate puts the qubit in a superposition state which gives us a value of |-> or |+>

After the player gets the value they need to win, the player must direct their dot into the measurement gate to measure their qubit and condense it back into a single value. 

## Future Additions
During the hackathon, our team came up with many great ideas that got put on the shelf because of a lack of time. Here is a list of the developments we would like to implement in the near future. 


Implementing the concept of entanglement (two lines going in opposite directions w/ one control)
Creating a single player game with AI
Making the game a functional webpage

## Final Notes
We had such a great time at this hackathon. It was a great learning experience and our team had so much fun together. We hope to continue to implement future changes to the game and make it more functional. We just hope that Dots and Gates will help future quantum leaders understand the concept of quantum gates.
